This is the data repository for publicly available code and data to conduct analyses in the paper titled "Low-intensity fires mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires in California's forests."

We use a synthetic control approach to analyze twenty years of satellite-based fire activity data across 124,186 km2 of forests in California, and provide evidence that low-intensity fires substantially reduce the risk of future high-intensity fires.

<b>Code: </b><br>

1. [`data_processing`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/wildfire_mitigation/tree/main/data_processing) process downloaded geospatial data from various data sources into a tabular for statistical analysis purpose.

2. [`balancing`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/wildfire_mitigation/tree/main/balancing) apply covariate balancing synthetic control approach to obtain control weights to create the synthetic control region.

3. [`analysis`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/wildfire_mitigation/tree/main/analysis) conduct outcome analysis on covariate balanced data to generate main results and result graphs.

4. [`figures`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/wildfire_mitigation/tree/main/analysis) generate figures and tables in the main text and supplementary materials.
