This is the data repository for publicly available code and data to conduct analyses in the paper titled "Shaping wildfire policy towards ecological resilience: The reduction of fire risks post-wildfire."

Analyzing the causal impacts of wildfire mitigation strategies in California.

<b>Code: </b><br>

1. [`processing_code`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/wildfire_mitigation/tree/main/processing_code) process downloaded spatial data from different sources into a tabular.

2. [`balancing`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/wildfire_mitigation/tree/main/balancing) apply covariate balance appraoche to obtain control weights to create "synthetic controls".

3. [`analysis`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/wildfire_mitigation/tree/main/analysis) outcome analysis on covariate balanced data to generate results and graphs.
